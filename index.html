            <p>Dances with Robots explores interdisciplinary collaborations at the intersection of choreography and technology, uncovering new insights into how these fields connect.</p>
            <h4>Season Two, coming in 2025</h4>
            <p>Season One [LINK] focused on the emerging field of "choreorobotics" in relation to Boston Dynamics and their AI Institute. Season Two follows an ambitious experiment, supporting four dancers in exploring movement in microgravity aboard a parabolic flight. Through conversations with astronauts, engineers, artists, and anthropologists, the podcast examines how space exploration will shape the artistic and cultural practices of the future.</p>
            <h4>Join us at the Conference </h4>
            <p>DWR was created by the CRCI team as an alternative to the annual gathering during the COVID-19 pandemic. Join us on June 12, 13, and 14 at Brown University, where we will continue to expand upon the conversations and community fostered through our podcast.</p>

        <p class="valueLang">Dances with Robots wields intersectional feminist methodologies to resist racist, ablest, classist and mysogynist violence in emerging technologies and creative production. These methods are emergent, and informed by active research, audience input and the listener community.</p>
