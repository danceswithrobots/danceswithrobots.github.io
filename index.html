        <h4>The Conference for Research on Choreographic Interfaces (CRCI) explores the braid of choreography, computation and surveillance through an interdisciplinary lens.</h4>
           <h5>Our Mission</h5>
        <p>CRCI (pronounced “Circe”) explores the braid of choreography, computation, and surveillance through an interdisciplinary lens. Our aim is to counter the violence of body-surveilling and algorithmic technologies by channeling resources to artists, organizers and scholars who center bodies and computation in their work for social justice.</p>
           <h5>Vision</h5>
        <p>CRCI engages the expertise of a wildly diverse and intimidatingly heterogeneous group of critics, theorists, computer scientists, dancers, roboticists, ethnographers, poets, designers, improvisers, and organizers, among others. We develop programming that makes time and space for sustained dialogue and collaborative movement, traversing disparate frames of knowledge.</p>
        <p>In doing this, CRCI aims to create curriculum and community committed to making productive interventions in the development of emerging art and technologies. These interventions can take the form of creative works, curricular design, human / computer and human / robot interfaces, publications, and conversations.</p>
        <p>While our current focus is the DWR podcast, our intention is to expand this work in the future to foster equitably collaborative research projects, policy work, and expansive digital programming.</p>
           <h5>Why Choreography?</h5>
        <p>CRCI understands choreography as a function of processing and computation, ranging from gestural human / computer interfaces (such as the “swipe” and “pinch-to-zoom”) to more subtle interplay between bodies and surveilling technologies such as social media, drones, robots and satellites. At times, these technologies coerce our movements through space and time, extracting scads of data in the process, and implicating our bodies in the well-documented abuses of surveillance capitalism.</p>
        <p>To resist the violences of bodily datafication, CRCI centers bodies and movement in all of our programming, research, and curriculum. Drawing extensively on embodied knowledge and choreographic practice, we collaboratively develop ethical, aesthetic and insurgent frameworks alongside our communities, with the belief that somatic practices can resist, and ideally reverse, the harmful effects of surveillance technologies.</p>

        <p class="valueLang">As a conference, CRCI works towards justice by bringing explicitly anti-racist, anti-ableist, anti-classist, and intersectional feminist methodologies to the realm of emerging technologies and creative production. These methodologies are constantly evolving, informed by research, current literature, and conference attendees' input.
