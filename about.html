            <p>As a conference, CRCI works towards justice by bringing explicitly anti-racist, anti-ableist, anti-classist, and intersectional feminist methodologies to the realm of emerging technologies and creative production. These methodologies are constantly evolving, informed by research, current literature, and conference attendees' input.
